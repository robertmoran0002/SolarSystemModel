    "# Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "The motion of large objects in the solar system is very well understood: Kepler's laws of planetary motion are one of the first applications of the law of gravitation that we all learn in intro physics.  However, we know that gravity becomes complicated quickly: even though the motion of _two_ objects can be solved on pen and paper, the \"three-body problem\" (motion of three massive objects under gravity) already has no analytic solutions.  So tracking a single object (or even several) as it moves through the gravitational field of the solar system is not doable with pen and paper - making it a great candidate for numerical study.\n",
    "\n",
    "For this project, you'll begin by modeling the Sun and the planets of the solar system in their known orbits.  Then, you will write a code which can solve for the motion of a small object through the complex gravity field of the Sun and planets.  The main physics goals will involve looking at incoming asteroids and comets to see if they pose a threat of a collision with the Earth, and studying the motion of 'Oumuamua - the first interstellar object recorded passing through our solar system."
